## 3.1.3 Avoid missalignement on V\_G41 valves with fittings

<!-- image -->

On threaded valves it's possible that the actuator is missaligned on the valve due to a collision with the fitting. If so, please take care for correct mounting, either by turning the actuator or by adjusting the fitting (e.g. use a second sealing to change fitting position).

## 3.1.7 Accessories

Before fitting the accessory items shown below, the following steps must be performed:

- 1. Actuator is mechanically connected to a Siemens valve.
- 2. Observe compatibility and choice of combinations. Refer to "Accessories" (page 13).
- 3. Disconnect actuator from power. Attention if AC 230 V connected danger of life!
- 4. Only required with actuators without fail safe function: Using the manual adjuster, drive the actuator's stem to the fully retracted position and fix the coupling. See 'Manual operation' and 'Fixing coupling' (page 45).
- 5. When mounting two different accessories watch out for correct plug-in space A or B (see below).
- 6. To fi t   a n   a u x i l i a r y   s w i t c h ,   p o t e n t i o m e t e r   o r   f u n c t i o n   m o d u l e ,   t h e   h o u s i n g   c o v e r must be removed.

Before making the function check, the following preconditions must be satisfied:

- · Environmental conditions specified in chapter "Technical data" (page 55)
- · Actuator is mechanically connected to a Siemens valve
- · Actuator is in "Manual operation" mode (page 51).

The actuator can be operated with the help of the "Manual adjuster" (see page 51).

- · Ensure that the actuator's and valve's stem, or actuator's and valve's spindle are securely connected in all positions.
- · If the actuator is forced to travel beyond its end positions, overload protection responds.
- · Observe information given in chapter "Acting direction and flow characteristic" on page 44.

Before making the function check, the following preconditions must be satisfied:

- · Environmental conditions specified in chapter "Technical data" (page 55).
- · Actuator is mechanically connected to a Siemens valve.
- · Actuator is in "Automatic" mode (page 51).
- · Actuator and, if required, accessories are correctly fitted and connected. Also refer to "Connection terminals" (page 58).

Calibration is required with modulating actuators and SA..61.. before the function check.

Before making the calibration, the following preconditions must be satisfied:

- · A description of the calibration function is given in chapter "Calibration" (page 44).
- · Housing cover is removed (step 6 "Special notes on mounting", page 26).

## Maintenance

The actuators are maintenance-free.

## 3.2.2 Disposal

The products contain electrical and electronic components and must not be disposed of together with domestic waste. This applies in particular to the printed circuit board.

Legislation may demand special handling of certain components, or it may be sensible from an ecological point of view.

Observe all local and currently valid legislation.
