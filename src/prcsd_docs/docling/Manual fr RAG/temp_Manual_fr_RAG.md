## THERMALERT CI

The Thermalert ® CI ™ Compact Infrared Sensor series of online instruments are noncontact infrared temperature measurement systems.  They are designed to measure accurately and repeatably the amount of heat energy emitted from an object and to convert that energy into a measurable electrical signal.

Each model (see Table 1) comes with a 1 m (3 ft) cable and two mounting nuts and is designed for easy integration into standard 4-wire systems.  There are J or K thermocouple output models or 10 mV/°C voltage output models if your application is susceptible to noise or requires a long cable run.  The electronics are protected by a rugged NEMA 4 stainless steel housing.

## INSTALLATION

The installation process consists of the following:

- GLYPH<127> Preparation
- GLYPH<127> Mechanical Installation
- GLYPH<127> Electrical Installation

The most important part of the installation process is preparation.  Please read the following section thoroughly before proceeding with the mechanical and electrical installations.

## Preparation

Distance and Spot Size -The size of the area (spot size) you wish to measure determines the distance between the sensor and the target (see Figure 3 for distances and spot sizes).  The spot size must not be larger than the target.  Mount the sensor so the measured spot is the same or smaller than the target.  Figure 4 is an overview of proper sensor placement.

Figure 4:  Proper Sensor Placement

Ambient Temperature -The sensing head is designed to operate in ambient temperatures from 0 to 70°C (32 to 160°F).  For ambient temperatures above 70°C (160°F), a factory installed air/water-cooled housing option is available that allows operation in ambient conditions up to 260°C (500°F) with water cooling. The air/water-cooled housing option comes with a high-temperature cable and integrated air purging.

Atmospheric Quality -Smoke, fumes, dust, and other contaminants can coat the lens and cause erroneous temperature readings.  We recommend using the air purge collar accessory in these types of environments to keep the lens clean.  (The air/water-cooled housing comes with integrated air purging.)

Electrical Interference -To minimize electrical or electromagnetic interference or 'noise,' mount the sensor away from motors producing large step load changes.

Wiring -Before installing, be sure to check the distance between the sensor and the monitoring/controlling device.  If necessary, extension cables are available as accessories.

Power -Have available a 12-24 VDC, 10 mA, power supply.

## Mechanical Installation

All sensors come with a 1 m (3 ft) cable and 2 mounting nuts.  You can mount the sensor in brackets or cutouts of your own design, or you can use the fixed and adjustable mounting bracket accessories.  Figures 5 through 7 show the mounting bracket accessories' and sensor's dimensions.

## Air/Water-cooled Housing with integrated air purge

-

The air/water-cooled housing option (Figure 8) allows the sensor to withstand ambient temperatures up to 260° C (500° F) with water cooling and the high-temperature cable.  (The high-temp cable is standard when the housing is ordered as an option.)  It has 1/8' NPT fittings for water and air.  Water temperature should be 15-30° C (60-86° F) for best performance.  Chilled water below 10° C (50° F) is not recommended. Without the high-temperature cable, the sensor can withstand ambient temperatures only up to 105° C  (220° F) with water cooling.

Figure 8:  Air/Water-cooled Housing

<!-- image -->

Air Purge Collar -The air purge collar accessory (Figure 9) is used to keep dust, moisture, and other contaminants away from the lens.  It must be screwed in fully.  Air flows into the 10/32' fitting and out the front aperture.  Clean or 'instrument' air is recommended. The air purge collar accessory is not needed with the air/water-cooled housing.

## Electrical Installation

Sensor to Electronics Cable -The sensor to electronics cable is a 1m (3 ft), 4-wire, PVC cable.  One end is attached, at the factory, to the sensor head.  The other end has two pairs of wires and a bare shield (ground) wire (see Figure 11).

The unlabeled pair of wires is for connecting to a controller or chart recorder or for attaching to a thermocouple plug (for connecting to a thermocouple meter).  DO NOT CONNECT TO A POWER SOURCE.

The second pair of wires, with the label, is for connecting to a power source.

## WARNING

Incorrect wiring will cause severe, permanent damage to the sensor.

Pay close attention to the wiring diagram in Figure 11, and match your sensor to the appropriate output type in Table 4 or 5.  Wire accordingly.

DO NOT CONFUSE OUTPUT WIRES WITH POWER SUPPLY WIRES.

Right Angle Mirror -The right angle mirror accessory (Figure 10) allows a perpendicular view of a target.  It may be used when space is limited or when you need to avoid excessive radiation to the sensor.  This can be mounted either on the end of the sensor or on the air purge collar, but not on the air/water-cooled housing.

Note:  When using the right angle mirror, a small amount of energy emitted by the source is lost, which results in a lower than actual temperature reading.  To compute the corrected temperature, use this formula:

T = 1.035Tm - .035Tamb

where T =corrected temperature, Tm =temperature reading with mirror, and Tamb =ambient temperature.  All temperatures are in either °C or °F.

Wiring -Wire the electronics cable using Figure 11 and Table 4 or 5 (for high temp cables) as a guide. USE ONLY THE OUTPUT TYPE OF YOUR SENSOR. WIRING TO THE WRONG OUTPUT WILL DAMAGE THE SENSOR. Note in Figure 11 that the numbers refer to the wire numbers in Table 4 or 5, which shows proper wiring connections based on insulation color coding.

Extension Cables -Extension cables are available as accessories.  Also available is a thermocouple connection kit.

## IMPORTANT

Be aware of the following when using the sensor:

- GLYPH<127> If the sensor is exposed to significant changes in ambient temperature (hot to cold or cold to hot), allow 20 minutes for the temperature to stabilize before taking or recording measurements.
- GLYPH<127> Do not operate the sensor near large electrical or magnetic fields (e.g., around arc welders or induction heaters).  Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) can cause measurement errors.
- GLYPH<127> Connectors or wires must be connected only to the appropriate input jacks or terminals.

Lens Cleaning -Keep the lens clean at all times.  Blow off loose particles (if not using the air purge accessory) with clean compressed air, then carefully wipe surface with moist cotten swab (water or water-based glass cleaner). DO NOT use solvents.

## OPERATION

Once the sensor is in position and you have made sure that the appropriate power, air, water, and cable connections are secure, the system is ready for continuous operation.

To operate, complete the following simple steps:

- 1. Turn on the power supply.
- 2. Turn on the meter, chart recorder, or controller.
- 3. Read/monitor the temperature.

## WARNING

If using the air/water-cooled housing, do not leave it in a heated environment with the coolant turned off.  Damage to the sensor and to the housing can occur.
